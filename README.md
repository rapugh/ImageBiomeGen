| -------------- |
| Terrain Control is not really maintained anymore. There are still a few people left that make changes every now and then, but no proper release has been made for a long time. The forums and build server are also gone, so you need to compile the source code yourself. A possible alternative is [OpenTerrainGenerator](https://openterraingenerator.com/), which is a fork of Terrain Control. |

This is a lobotomized version of <a href="https://github.com/MCTCP/TerrainControl">TerrainControl</a> to just have some simple biome mapping from a png. There's probably a lot of defunct code, as I'm not an experienced programmer and I'm really ad-hoc-ing this thing together. Terrain Control is the successor to the old <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/313991-phoenixterrainmod/">PhoenixTerrainMod</a>, which was based on the popular <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/71565-biomemod/">BiomeTerrainMod</a>.
